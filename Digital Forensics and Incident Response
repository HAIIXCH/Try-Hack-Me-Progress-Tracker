### DFIR: An Introduction
  Explanation: The combination of digital forensics and incident response. The 2 domains working interdependently allow DFIR analysts to detect, investigate, and respond to cyber incidents swiftly. 


### Windows Forensics 1
  Explanation: Tracking artifacts, which are like footprints left behind on a system, to learn more about an incident/attacker/etc. 
  Tools: Windows Registry, Registry Explorer, RegRipper


### Windows Forensics 2
  Explanation: Learned structure of common file systems and briefly used Autopsy.
  Tools: Autopsy 


### Linux Forensics
  Explanation: Undertsanding where important system information resides and how to locate it. 
  Tools: CLI


### Autopsy
  Explanation: A parsing tool which allows for inspection of artifacts on a system. Allows for the forensic analysis of a computer system in question. 
  WICTSFTR: The time files are downloaded/accessed/deleted can be discovered using this tool. Even deleted files can be inspected. 


### Redline
  Explanation: A memory analysis tool used to investigate a potentially compromised Windows system by analysing a memory dump for suspicious processes, network activity, persistence, and IOCs.


### KAPE
  Explanation: A parsing tool which can be tailored to feed the user the data they are looking for.
  Key Points: Revolves around targets and modules. Targets are forensic artifacts that need to be collected. Modules process artifacts and extract info from them.


### Volatility
  Explanation: A tool used to extract data from memory dumps which is captured memory images (e.g., .raw, .mem, .vmem, .lime) taken from a system at a point in time.
  Key Points: CLI tool which uses python and analyses memory dumps, not live memory


### Velociraptor
 Explanaion: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### TheHive Project
  Explanation: A security incident response platform which allows security teams to track, investigate, and take action upon adversaries in a collaborative manner.


### Intro to Malware Analysis
  Explanation: Undertsanding how to analyse malware in a safe and secure manner.
  Key Points: Static analysis is analysing malware without running it, Dynamic analysis is executing the malware and observing its behaviour, Advanced malware analysis is controlling different points of executing a malware to  identify interesting stages. 


### Unattended
  Explanation: Investigating a system for suspected unauthorised activity and discovering what exactly this activity was.
  Tools: Autopsy, Registry Explorer


### Disgruntled
  Explanation: Investigating a linux system and locating artifacts of suspicious activity.


### Critical 
  Explanation: Learning the techniques to analyse memory dumps along with the volatility tool to collect important data for deeper investigation.
