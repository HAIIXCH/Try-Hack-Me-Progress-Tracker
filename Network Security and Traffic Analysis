### Traffic Analysis Essentials
  Explanation: Undertsanding network security operations and analysing network traffic. 
  What I Can Teach Someone From This Room: Traffic entering a system can be captured like a video camera recording footage. This capture can be analysed to see what is malicious data/requests/intentions and whats legitimate traffic. The "bad" traffic can be blocked entirely from its IP address or certain ports can be blocked to stop receiving or sending data. 


### Snort
  Explanation: A network intrusion detection and prevention system (NIDS/NIPS) that monitors and analyses network traffic in real time to detect suspicious activity and enhance overall system security.
  WICTSFTR: Specific IP addresses can be blocked from sending packets to a system using snort and you can make an exception to always allow traffic from specific IP's. This is by using Snort rules.


### Snort Challenge - The Basics
  Explanation: A scenario cahllenge where we created/fixed Snort rules to analyse traffic for information we need.
  WICTSFTR: You can detect specific file types, like JPEGs, in network traffic by using their hexadecimal file signatures (magic numbers) in a Snort content rule.
