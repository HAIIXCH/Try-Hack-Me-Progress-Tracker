### Traffic Analysis Essentials
  Explanation: Undertsanding network security operations and analysing network traffic. 
  What I Can Teach Someone From This Room: Traffic entering a system can be captured like a video camera recording footage. This capture can be analysed to see what is malicious data/requests/intentions and whats legitimate traffic. The "bad" traffic can be blocked entirely from its IP address or certain ports can be blocked to stop receiving or sending data. 


### Snort
  Explanation: A network intrusion detection and prevention system (NIDS/NIPS) that monitors and analyses network traffic in real time to detect suspicious activity and enhance overall system security.
  WICTSFTR: Specific IP addresses can be blocked from sending packets to a system using snort and you can make an exception to always allow traffic from specific IP's. This is by using Snort rules.


### Snort Challenge - The Basics
  Explanation: A scenario cahllenge where we created/fixed Snort rules to analyse traffic for information we need.
  WICTSFTR: You can detect specific file types, like JPEGs, in network traffic by using their hexadecimal file signatures (magic numbers) in a Snort content rule.


### Snort Challenge - Live Attacks
  Explanation: Tasked to stop a brute force and reverse shell attack. Investigating traffic on VM and analysisng what is malicious and creating rules to stop it.


### NetworkMiner
  Explanation: Analyses pcap files allowing for useful features such as keyword searching. Similar to Autopsy but specically a traffic pasring tool. 
  WICTSFTR: Using this tool to intercept plain text communication, I can pick up anything such as user credentials. 


### ZEEK
  Explanation: Network monitoring tool used to analyse PCAP files and live network traffic. Generates range of log files during scans, each offering detailed insight into specific aspects of the captured traffic
  WICTSFTR: You can use ZEEK to create signature based rules. These can be used to search for specific patterns or behaviours within a PCAP file.


### ZEEK Exercises
  Explanation: Assigned to investigate given pcap files and find specifc information from them. 
  Key Points: Main takeaway is to understand how to navigate/search the outputted files from zeek. This will allow for us to easily locate the details we are looking for.  


### Brim
  Explanation: Tool which allows pcap files to be investigated deeply. Configurable rule searching allows for tailored search queries.
  Key Points: Although the default search queires are useful, they should not be relied upon and learning to search for information with your own rules is recommended.


### Wireshark: The Basics
  Explanation: Understanding how wireshark is used to analyse pcap files and deeply investigating specific packets.
  Key Points: Wireshark has a great GUI which helps analysts locate data they want. 
  WICTSFTR: Using the toolbar we can use the 'go to packet' to move straight to a requested packet number. 


### Wireshark: Packet Operations
  Explanation: Intricate methods of finding desired informations through understanding filters and tools at our disposal.
  Key Points: Custom tailoring filters is an ideal way to find information. 


### Wireshark: Traffic Analysis
  Explanation: Case scenarios for various protocols such as http/s, icmp, ftp, and more whilst being tasked to disscest packets, uncover information, use filters, and understand frames and packets. 
  Key Points: Understanding where the information you are looking for, within the structure of a packet, is located is a huge help.  


### TShark: The Basics
  Explanation: A command line version of wireshark used for filtering/displaying live traffic or pcaps.
  Key Points: Being confident with the CLI is a major incentive, using capture filters we can specify the amount of traffic we want to save in a file.
