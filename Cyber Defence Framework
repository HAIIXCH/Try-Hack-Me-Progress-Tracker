### Junior Security Analyst Intro
  Skills: Reading alerts and choosing nect steps  
  Tools Used: Lab which mimicked a real SOC monitoring setup
  Takeaway: 
  Learned: Role of a SOC in a system, different security tiers and their repective roles


### Pyramid Of Pain
  explanation: A model showing the remnants attackers leave behind, which defenders can use to detect or disrupt them — with higher-level indicators causing more difficulty for attackers to change.
  Learned: - 7 tiers defenders can use to block attackers. 
           - Top-tier indicators are harder for defenders to block, but doing so forces attackers to change their entire approach, not just simple tools 


### Cyber Kill Chain
  Explanation: A 7-step attack process which mimics the typical behaviour of attackers
  Learned: 7 steps and each process taken at each step


### Unified Kill Chain
  Explanation: A more updated and advanced framework compared to the cyber kill chain, highlighting the 18 phases attackers utilise.
  Learned: Specific steps attackers take at each phase of the framework. 


### Diamond Model
  Explanation: A model that maps the four core elements of an attack — adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim — to help analysts understand the relationships and patterns behind cyber threats.


### MITRE
  Explanastion: A large, structured database of cyber groups, incidents, and techniques used by professionals to understand threats and improve defences.

### Summit
  Explanation: Simulation lab configuring security tools to detect and prevent malware from executing in a system.
